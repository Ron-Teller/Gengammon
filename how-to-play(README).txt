1. open terminal in folder location
2. type command: java -jar backgammon.jar
3. in "Game Mode" choose 'Normal' - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
4. in "Algorithm" choose 'Genetic' - so you can play against an ai trained by a genetic algorithm. The ai itself is stored in one of the files in the repository (see next step)
5. Drag and drop an ai file (which is basically a neural network that was trained using a genetic algorithm to play backgammon) in the repository into the "Neural Network File:"
You can play against any trained neural network by dropping in different files containg a neural network.
We have supplied 2 neural networks, named "AI_30000_iterations" and "AI_45000_iterations".
6. Press "Start Game"
